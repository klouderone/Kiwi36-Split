![Kiwi36 Full Res Outside Touched Up](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3767477-0a5a-48e6-8ac1-671d68c05dcf)

The Kiwi 36 split is the perfect split keyboard for absolute beginners, giving the freedom to use **3 kinds of switches**, while also being packed full of features such as **USB-C interconnect** and **battery support**!
The Kiwi 36 is easy to build, having the option to use mostly through-hole components, and bigger pads for surface mount components. 

There is a wide range of support for different accessories, including 3D printable Covers for Trackpads, Nice!Views, and OLEDs!

The Kiwi is a minimalist board, aimed to be as compact as possible, yet very easy to build, with the ability to use either leaded diodes or surface mount diodes.
It is inteneded to be used with home row-mods.

This board was inspired by the [Fifi by Ray Chengy](https://github.com/raychengy/fifi_split_keeb).

Please make sure to read everything before building or using.

## IMPORTANT

**ALWAYS make sure that you DO NOT plug the USB-C interconnect cable into the host device (Computer, Laptop, iPad)**. This **WILL** result in the microcontroller being broken, and needing to be replaced.
I plan to design some protection against this, though i need to figure out how to do this with parts that are not surface mounted, and can be soldered by the consumer.
